/**
 * In JavaScript, the boolean type has only two possible values: true and false.
 * These values are often used in conditional statements to control the flow of the program.
 * For example, you can use boolean values to check if a condition is met or not.
 * To initialize a boolean value in a variable, you can simply assign true or false to it.
